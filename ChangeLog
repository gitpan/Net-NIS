	* NIS.pm: Version to 0.32

2002-07-04  Ed Santiago  <esm@ascend.gingerbear.org>

	* t/yperr_num.t:
	import :all, as a test that all the YPERR_xxx constants are exported.

	* NIS.pm:
	Bug reported by Damien Chrisment <damien.chrisment at freealter.com>:

	    use Net::NIS qw(:all);

	...results in warnings when using YPERR_xxx constants:

	    Prototype mismatch: sub Net::NIS::YPERR_SUCCESS vs () at [...]/NIS.pm line 129.

	Solution: Get rid of some special-case code I was using for AUTOLOAD
	(added in revision 1.9 of Tie-NIS, 2002/02/13).  I seem to have grabbed
	it from h2xs, but am no longer sure.

	In any case, it's bad news.  Maybe with this checkin, it won't work
	with Perl 5.005 any more.  We'll see.

	* MANIFEST: add ChangeLog

	* t/yperr_string.t:
	Hardcode locale (LC_ALL) to 'C', so we always get the English messages
	no matter what the current user's locale setting is.

	Thanks to Gustavo Chaves <gustavo at cpqd.com.br> for reporting this.

2002-02-21  Ed Santiago  <esm@pobox.com>

	* README: tests now work under 5.005

	* README: add note about warnings

	* t/wantarray.t:
	test the array and scalar return of yp_get_default_domain

	* t/tabletest, t/test:

2002-02-19  Ed Santiago  <esm@pobox.com>

	* NIS.xs: indentation: to 4

	* MANIFEST: add wantarray.t

	* t/table.t: test the table interface (lightly)

	* MANIFEST: add tests

	* t/yperr_string.t:
	use a form of the regex test that works under Perl 5.005

	* t/ypcat.t:
	no longer do the :print: thing, since it's 5.6-and-above only

	* NIS.xs:
	new YP_RETURN macro, checks wantarray() and returns the desired result

	* README: bring up-to-date

	* NIS.pm: add __END__ ... it's required for autosplit

	* NIS.pod: integrate Ed's changes

	* NIS.pm: remove POD, now integrated into NIS.pod

	* NIS.pm: VERSION to 0.30

	* t/domainname.t, t/ypcat.t, t/yperr_num.t, t/yperr_string.t:
	tests for new (mostly tied) Net::NIS

	* NIS.pm: === COMPLETE OVERHAUL ===

	Imported from Ed's earlier Tie::NIS package

	Nothing really removed, since NIS.pm from NIS-a2 was nearly empty

	* Makefile.PL: + DISTNAME is now "Net-NIS", not "NIS"
	+ VERSION is now obtained from NIS.pm
	+ spacing, other minor changes

2002-02-18  Ed Santiago  <esm@pobox.com>

	* NIS.xs: CHECKPOINT: integrated in a whole bunch of esm code:

	 + include <sys/types.h>, for FreeBSD
	 + define YPERR_SUCCESS, for systems (like Solaris) which don't
	 + add constant() function, autogenerated by h2xs

	 + Whee!  Add _yp_tie_status() function, and magic $!-like variable.

	 + bug fixes: if key lookup fails, try with trailing NUL (e.g., if
	   yp_match("foo",3) fails, try ("foo\0",4).  Also, in all returned
	   keys and values, trim trailing NUL.

	 + Preliminary support for using GIMME_V, to test if caller wants
	   array -- in which case we return (status,value) -- or scalar.
